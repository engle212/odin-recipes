        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

            <li>1/2 cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
            <li>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or a fork until well blended. Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
            <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
